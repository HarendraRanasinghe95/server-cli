# Migrating to `v3.x.x` from `v2.x.x`

Version `3.x.x` contained a number of breaking changes and will need to be handled before using the Server CLI to deploy server-side HTTPS endpoints again.

## Node Version Support

### `v2.x.x`

Only Node `6.10.x` was supported in the execution environment.

### `v3.x.x`

NodeJS `8.10.x` will now be the only version of node supported in the execution environment.

See [Breaking changes between v6 LTS and v8 LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/wiki-archive/blob/master/Breaking-changes-between-v6-LTS-and-v8-LTS.md) for more information on breaking changes.
